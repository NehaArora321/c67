Story
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon(berry) tree which was on the banks of the river. In the same forest,
there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day crocodile came to banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered 
him some berries. The crocodile came back for more berries as he liked them. As days passed, the crocodile and monkey became good friends.
	One day monkey gave fruits for crocodile's wife. She liked berries but was jealous with monkey as her husband was spending more time
with monkey than her. She insisted her husband to bring monkey's heart as according to her if berries are sweet so as his heart will be.
